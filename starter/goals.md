# Project goals

**The long term goal** for the Eclipse OMR project is to foster an open community of language runtime developers that will collaborate and collectively innovate with hardware platform designers, operating system developers, as well as tool and framework developers. Together, they will provide a robust runtime technology platform so that language implementers can much more quickly and easily create fully featured languages to enrich the options available to programmers.

It is our community's fervent goal to be one of active contribution, improvement, and continual consumption. We operate under the [Eclipse Code of Conduct](https://eclipse.org/org/documents/Community_Code_of_Conduct.php) to promote fairness, openness, and inclusion.

There are some **active contribution projects** underway right now:

- **documentation:** code comments are great, but we need more overview documentation so we're writing that
- **faq:** Frequently Asked Questions from real people's questions (request: ask questions!)
- **starters:** relatively simple but useful work items meant for people new to the project
- **diag:** more diagnostic support for language runtimes to help developers and users
- **hcagent:** the core code for the IBM Health Center agent for interfacing to a runtime
- **jit:** Just In Time compiler for generating native code for several platforms into managed code caches
- **gc:** adding generational and other GC policies
